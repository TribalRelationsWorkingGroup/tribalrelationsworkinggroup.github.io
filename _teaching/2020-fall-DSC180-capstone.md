Overview
======

This capstone section mainly focuses on text mining and natural language processing. We will explore cutting-edge research papers in these areas together and try to replicate some experiments for a deeper, better understanding. 

We will mostly have discussions in a Q&A form, instead of traditional lectures. Due to the COVID-19, the discussions will be online over Zoom.
