## Week 1: Practicing the Art of Data Science {#week1}

### Abstract

Data science embraces interdisciplinary methodologies and tools, such as those in statistics, artificial intelligence/machine learning, data management, algorithms, computation and economics. Practicing data science to empower innovative applications, however, remains an art due to many factors beyond technology, such as sophistication of application scenarios, business demands, and the central role of human being in the loop. In this talk, I share with the audience some experience and lessons I learned from my practice of data science research and development. First, I illustrate the core value of building domain-oriented, end-to-end data science solutions that can help people gain new interpretable domain knowledge. Second, using network embedding as an example, I demonstrate that the nature of data science practice is to connect challenges in vertical applications with general scientific principles and tools. I also discuss some future directions, particularly about data strategies for enterprises and organizations on data as assets, privacy, fairness, accountability, and transparency.

## Week 2: Learning with all experiences: A standardized ML formalism {#week2}

### Abstract

In handling a wide range of experiences ranging from data instances, knowledge, constraints, to rewards, adversaries, and lifelong interplay in an ever-growing spectrum of tasks, contemporary ML/AI research has resulted in a large multitude of learning paradigms (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, active, reinforcement, adversarial learning), models, optimization algorithms, etc. While pushing the field forward rapidly, these results also make a comprehensive grasp of existing ML techniques more and more difficult, and make standardized, reusable, repeatable, and reliable practice and further development of ML/AI products quite costly, if possible at all. In this talk, I’ll present a standardized formalism of machine learning that provides a unified mathematical framework for learning with all experiences. The formalism offers a vehicle for understanding, unifying, and generalizing current major paradigms of learning algorithms, and guidance of operationalizing ML for creating problem solutions in a composable and mechanic manner. I’ll show its applications in controllable text generation, learning with structured knowledge, automated data manipulation, stabilizing GAN training, etc.
