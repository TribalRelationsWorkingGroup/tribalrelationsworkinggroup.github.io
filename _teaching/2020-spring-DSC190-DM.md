Online Lecturing
======

Due to the COVID-19, this course will be delivered over Zoom: [https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/632116245](https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/632116245)

Overview
======

This course mainly focuses on introducing current methods and models that are useful in analyzing and mining real-world data. It will cover frequent pattern mining, regression & classification, clustering, and representation learning. No previous background in machine learning is required, but all participants should be comfortable with programming, and with basic optimization and linear algebra. 

There is no textbook required, but here are some recommended readings:
- The classical data mining textbook "[Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques](https://books.google.com/books/about/Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques.html?id=pQws07tdpjoC&source=kp_book_description)" by Jiawei Han et al.
- The classical data mining/machine learning book "[Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://books.google.com/books/about/Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning.html?id=HL4HrgEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description)" by Christopher M. Bishop
- The new "[Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/)" book by Aston Zhang et al.

Midterm (26%)
======

TBD. It will cover all lectures given before the Midterm.

Data Mining Challenge (25%)
======

TBD. It will be a individual-based data mining competition with quantitative evaluation.

Project (25%)
======

- **Choice 1: Team-Based Open-Ended Project**
    - 1 to 4 members per team. More members, higher expectation.
    - Define your own research problem and justify its importance
    - Come up with your hypothesis and find some datasets for verification
    - Design your own models or try a large variety of existing models
    - Write a 4 to 8 pages report (research-paper like)
    - Submit your codes
- **Choice 2: Individual-Based Deep Dive into Data Mining Methods**
    - [Tentative plan](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pixbz0yvfzqd31j/Project%20Choice%202%20Plan.pdf?dl=0)
    - Implement 4 models learned from this course from scratch.
    - Skeleton codes will be provided. Your work is more like "filling in blanks".
    - Write a 4-page report (1 page per model) describing your interesting findings.
