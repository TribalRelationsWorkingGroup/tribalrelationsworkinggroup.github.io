Overview
======

This course mainly focuses on introducing current methods and models that are useful in analyzing and mining real-world data. It will cover frequent pattern mining, regression & classification, clustering, and representation learning. No previous background in machine learning is required, but all participants should be comfortable with programming, and with basic optimization and linear algebra. There is no textbook required, but the classical data mining textbook "Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques" is recommended for reading.
