Online Lecturing
======

Due to the COVID-19, this course will be delivered over Zoom. All lectures will be recorded.

Overview
======

This course mainly focuses on introducing current methods and models that are useful in analyzing and mining real-world text data. It will put emphasis on unsupervised, weakly supervised, and distantly supervised methods for text mining problems, including information retrieval, open-domain information extraction, text summarization (both extractive and generative), and knowledge graph construction. Bootstrapping, comparative analysis, learning from seed words and existing knowledge bases will be the key methodologies.

There is no textbook required, but there are recommended readings for each lecture (at the end of the slides).


Prerequisites
======

Knowledge about Machine Learning and Data Mining; Comfortable coding using Python, C/C++, or Java; Math and Stat skills.

TA and Office Hours
======

- Dheeraj Mekala (dmekala AT eng.ucsd.edu)

Note: all times are in **Pacific Time**.

Grading
======

- Homework: 10% each. Your lowest (of four) homework grades is dropped (or one homework can be skipped).
- Text Mining Challenge: 30%.
- Project: 50%.
- You should complete all work individually, except for the Project.
- Late submissions are NOT accepted.

Lecture Schedule
