I'm an Assistant Professor at University of California, San Diego, jointly appointed by Computer Science and Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute. I obtained my Ph.D. from Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). I received my B.E. from Computer Science Department, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), China, where I was a member of the 2010 [ACM Honored class](http://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/), now part of Zhiyuan College in SJTU. 

My research focuses on developing principled *data-driven* approaches, with *little human curation and labeling*, to transform unstructured text data into structured heterogeneous information networks, on which actionable knowledge can be further uncovered flexibly and effectively based on user's instructions.

My research has been recognized by many prestigious awards, including Computer Science Excellence Scholarship from CS@Illinois, Grand Prize of Yelp Dataset Challenge in 2015, Google PhD Fellowship in Structured Data and Database Management in 2017, and C.W. Gear Outstanding Graduate Award in 2018.

In addition, I love competitive programming contests, such as ACM/ICPC, Topcoder Open, Google Codejam, Facebook Hackercup, etc. I'm now a coach of the UCSD's ICPC team and I enjoy mentoring and coaching students.
